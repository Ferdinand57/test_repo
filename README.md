# Explain how you implement the checklist above step by step! (not just following the tutorial).

### Ensure the deployment of your Django project is running smoothly. For issues related to PWS, which cannot yet be integrated with Flutter, the Teaching Assistant Team will provide further information later. In the meantime, you are allowed to perform integration on localhost only.
