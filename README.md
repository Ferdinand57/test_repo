# The checklist for this assignment is as follows:


## Create at least one new page in the application, specifically a form page to add a new item with the following requirements:

### Use at least three input elements: name, amount, and description. Add input elements according to the model in your previous Django project.


### Include a Save button.


### Each input element in the form must also be validated with the following criteria:


- No input field should be left empty.


- Each input field must contain data in the model's data type.


warning: Pay attention to cases such as negative numbers, minimum string length (if applicable), maximum string length (if applicable), and so on. It's not just about data types!

## Redirect the user to the new item addition form when they press the Add Item button on the main page.


## Display the data from the form in a pop-up after pressing the Save button on the new item addition form page.


## Create a drawer in the application with the following requirements:


### The drawer should contain at least two options: Home and Add Item.


### When selecting the Home option, the application should redirect the user to the main page.


### When selecting the Add Item option, the application should redirect the user to the new item addition form page.
